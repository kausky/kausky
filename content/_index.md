      subtitle: 'Building AI Solutions with Limitless Possibilities'
      text: |-
        I'm an ML Engineer and Software Engineer 3 at Tune AI, specializing in developing and deploying machine learning models and distributed systems for real-world applications. My work focuses on creating robust AI solutions that solve complex problems and drive business value.

        ### Key Areas of Expertise:
        - **Generative AI & LLMs**: Building high-throughput proxy servers handling over 1M requests/day for OpenAI, Anthropic, and other LLM providers
        - **Document Processing**: Developing multimodal extraction pipelines processing 100K+ documents daily with ~95% precision/recall
        - **Cloud Infrastructure**: Creating flexible, scalable infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Azure using Kubernetes and IaC
        - **MLOps**: Implementing robust monitoring, logging, and deployment pipelines for ML systems

        The name "Kausky" comes from Aakash (meaning "sky" in Hindi) and Kaushik (surname, "kau") -> kausky. This represents my vision of building AI solutions with limitless possibilities.

        ### Google Summer of Code - Mlpack
        As a developer for Google Summer of Code with Mlpack, I:
        - Implemented MobileNetV1 and ResNet model builders in C++, integrating pre-trained weights to reduce training time by 40%
        - Added Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Softmin Activation function with backward implementation
        - Spearheaded the migration of approximately 60% of core testing suite from Boost to Catch2
        - Addressed over 100 static code analysis warnings and style issues
